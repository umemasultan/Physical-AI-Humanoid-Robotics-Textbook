# Glossary

A comprehensive list of key terms used throughout this textbook.

---

## A

**Action (ROS 2)**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks that provides feedback during execution and can be canceled.

**Actuator**: A device that converts energy into motion, used to move robot joints. Common types include electric motors, servos, and hydraulic cylinders.

## C

**Coordinate Frame**: A reference system defined by an origin point and orientation axes, used to describe positions and orientations in space.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: The number of independent parameters that define a robot's configuration. A 6-DoF arm can position and orient its end effector in any way within its workspace.

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors its real-world counterpart in real-time.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: AI that exists in and interacts with the physical world through a body, as opposed to purely digital AI.

**End Effector**: The device at the end of a robotic arm, designed to interact with the environment (e.g., gripper, tool).

## G

**Gazebo**: An open-source robotics simulator that provides physics simulation, sensor simulation, and ROS integration.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor that measures acceleration and angular velocity, used for orientation and motion tracking.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform built on Omniverse, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering.

## K

**Kinematics**: The study of motion without considering forces. In robotics, it relates joint angles to end effector positions.

## L

**LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging sensor that uses laser pulses to measure distances and create 3D maps of the environment.

**Launch File**: A ROS 2 file that specifies how to start multiple nodes with their configurations.

## M

**MoveIt2**: A ROS 2 framework for motion planning, manipulation, and control of robotic arms.

## N

**Node (ROS 2)**: A process that performs computation in ROS 2. Nodes communicate using topics, services, and actions.

## P

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world through embodied robots.

**Policy Learning**: A machine learning approach where an agent learns a mapping from observations to actions.

## R

**ROS 2**: Robot Operating System 2, a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.

**RViz2**: A 3D visualization tool for ROS 2 that displays sensor data, robot models, and other information.

## S

**Service (ROS 2)**: A synchronous communication pattern in ROS 2 for request-response interactions.

**Sensor**: A device that detects and measures physical properties such as light, distance, force, or temperature.

## T

**tf2**: The ROS 2 library for tracking coordinate frame transforms over time.

**Topic (ROS 2)**: An asynchronous communication channel in ROS 2 where nodes publish and subscribe to messages.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing a robot's physical structure, including links, joints, and visual properties.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A class of multimodal AI models that combine visual perception, language understanding, and action generation for robotics.
